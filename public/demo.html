    Despite of technical nature of the words, which presumably makes them longer; above density graph shows that Quantum Lorem Ipsum has fewer longer words than Lorem Ipsum. The argument against using gibberish, unrecognizeable, symantically obfuscated piece of text such as the original Lorem Ispum, is that the quantum version of it provides realism (at the expense of diverting attention from the design process) and I find it optically "correct".

    A number of times when desiging a page layout, I've come across moments where the design is optimized and in final stages of development; content is delivered and flown into the cascading text blocks and ... the result has changed. It no longer appears "correct". It is difficult to describe it in words. The following are two paragraphs in latin and english. Both are equally meaningless at the end, but latin is gibberish at the word-recognition level and english is gibberish at the sentence-recognition level.

    Etiam hendrerit pretium massa, sed pulvinar lorem ultrices in. In luctus  sagittis ante ut consequat. Aliquam erat volutpat. Cras ac sollicitudin  urna. Aenean dapibus lorem sed felis fermentum suscipit. Morbi sed  sapien eros. Suspendisse eu tempor arcu.

    The disguised common can't watch the piano. Is the fold guest better than the location? It was then the good system met the annual funny. The vacuous formal reports into the breakable formal. It was then the instinctive negotiation met the realistic evidence.
    So, why does the english version appear to have a better structure? I presume it has something to do with the way word recognition works in the visual/auditory pathways of the brain [1]. In the english paragraph which is obviously meaningless, our brain recognizes overall shapes of words and the relationship between them. At some later time in the pipeline, the limbic system tries to make sense of the sentence, we have an uncaught exception (in computer programming lingo): the visual system was happy with it, from V1-V5 regions of the brain do not catch symantic exceptions, that happens, I am guessing, in the fusiform-gyrus based on some of the things Dr. V.S. Ramachandran, a neuroscientist at the UC San Deigo, has presented in his talk repetoire.

    I think the design process, especially when dealing with typography and legibility, using realistic text is preferable, despite of what the underlying reason for its preference may be. Here is it is in its full glory, released until MIT license. The source of the material is various scientific texts hosted on Wikibooks.

    ###Quantum Lorem Ispum Text
    The fundamental concepts of classical physics, space, time, mass, and derived concepts, velocity, momentum, force, angular momentum, energy ... all rest on the principle that material points have trajectories. They are defined as lines in space-time. Even the dynamics of continuous, solid or fluid media describes the trajectories of the material points which constitute the bodies in motion. But the indeterminacy relation of Heisenberg prevents quantum particles from having such classical trajectories, since their position and velocity can not be exactly defined at the same time. How then can it explain all the appearances which legitimize the fundamental concepts of classical physics?
